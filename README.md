# computer-vision-techniques

In this repository, there are number of useful computer vision techniques such as SLIC Segmentation, Text Detection, Autocropping by template matching and Background Removing. I will add other techniques gradually to this repository. 

These techniques can be used separately or as a part of preprocessing stage for Machine Learning or Deep Learning processes. 

Authors are Dr. Hamid Doostmohammadi and Dr. Azadeh Nazemi.
